# Battleship
Command Line version of the pencil and paper game "Battleship". Made as a small personal project.

Initial setup uses a 8x8 board and 5 ships: Carrier (5), Battleship (4), Cruiser (3), Submarine (3) and Destroyer (2)
These can be edited in the initial lines of code.

The game uses three functions: one that generates the board, one that interprets the user entries a main function. The generateBoard function can be replaced with premadeBoard for testing with a premade board.
